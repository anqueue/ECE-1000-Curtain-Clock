# Curtain Clock

## Project Summary

Waking up to sunlight is proven to be the best way to wake up in the morning. However, when using curtains for privacy at night, it is difficult to wake up to sunlight. The curtain clock is a device that will automatically open the curtains in the morning, allowing sunlight to enter and wake you up. It was designed to open slowly to simulate a sunrise. You can also use the curtain clock to close the curtains at night. This is all powered by a Raspberry Pi Pico W, stepper motor, and custom 3D printed mechanical components.

## Project Capabilities

Currently, the curtain clock is capable of opening and closing the curtains either manually through the online dashboard, or automatically based on a set time. The rotations needed to open and close the curtains can also be adjusted on the fly to support different window sizes. The online dashboard was built from the ground up to allow for easy control of the curtain clock from anywhere in the world. The dashboard can also generate a QR code that can be scanned to allow temporary access for demonstration purposes.
